## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please enter a valid OpenWeatherMap API Key" error**
   - Ensure you've added your API key to the `API_KEY` variable in `app.py`
   - Verify your API key is active (new keys may take up to 10 minutes to activate)

2. **"Could not fetch weather data" error**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify city names are spelled correctly
   - Ensure your API key hasn't exceeded rate limits

3. **Module not found errors**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - Ensure you're using the correct Python environment
